Hello,

I made this site over winter break because I think instagram is overrated.

I dedicate this site to my mom and dad

And to my friends

Big thanks to midzer on github for making this jekyll theme (literally any documentation would have been nice but I'll let it slide)

Big thanks to github for letting me host stuff for free (u the best).

Big thanks again to my mom and dad.

This bio is long because the footer gets cut off when the text margin isn't long enough and I don't want to learn how to fix this problem yet
